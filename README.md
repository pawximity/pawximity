## 👤 About Me
I'm a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building backend systems and data pipelines. My current focus is transitioning into analytics and data engineering. This account documents that journey and is dedicated to hands-on projects related to ETL design, SQL-driven analysis, and turning operational data into insight.

### 🐺 In Memory of Angus
This project and anything else I create in this space, should I continue - is dedicated to my dog Angus. I’ll carry you with me as I learn, grow, and explore the world through data.
